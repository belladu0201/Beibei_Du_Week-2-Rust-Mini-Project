## Motivation
A chatbot is a computer program that can communicate with users in a natural language format, such as through text-based messaging. The motivation behind creating a chatbot is to provide automated communication that can handle repetitive tasks, provide customer support, and engage with users actively. Chatbots can collect data on user behavior and preferences, which can be used to improve the user experience. However, in my code, it is a very simple one without any data collection or NLP algorithmes. It is manually responding user's input.
