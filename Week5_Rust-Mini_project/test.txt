SONNET OF LOVE AND BEAUTY

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Two lovers met, their eyes did brightly gleam.
With passion pure, they spoke of love so true,
Of hearts that beat as one, forever new.

Her beauty shone as bright as summer's day,
Her smile, her grace, could take all breath away.
And he, with words so sweet and true did say,
"My love for thee, will never fade away."

Together they did walk in moonlit glade,
And spoke of dreams, of futures bright, unmade.
For in each other's arms, they found their way,
Their love, a bond that time could not decay.

So let us raise a glass to love so pure,
A union strong, that will forever endure.
For in this world of strife and constant pain,
True love will shine, and bring us hope again.
