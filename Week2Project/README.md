# IDS721 Week 2 Project in Rust
- The simple project that I have done for this week is to generate a function that takes a specific types of input and count the number of characters. Then it returned the length of the input. It sounds very simple but writing in Rust is pretty new to me. I followed the online tutorial to download the Rust and install other things like cargo. I have successfully run the code.

- I referenced from here: https://www.rust-lang.org/zh-CN/learn/get-started
- I also got help from Copilot and ChatGPT to teach me understand some of the syntax of the Rust Language. 

- The Code looks like the following:

- Some syntax Knowledge
- mut means mutable data type in Rust
- `::` is to specify the namespace and access the standard library or crates in Rust.
- Create is the fundamental unit of packaging and reuse.
